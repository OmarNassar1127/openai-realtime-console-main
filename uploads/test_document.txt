This is a test document about artificial intelligence and knowledge management.
      Text splitting is an important part of processing documents for RAG systems.
      When splitting text, we want to maintain context and readability.
      The chunks should break at natural boundaries like periods.
      This helps ensure that the retrieved context makes sense.
      Artificial intelligence systems can use these text chunks to provide relevant information.
      The RAG system combines retrieval and generation for better responses.

Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) Systems
RAG is a powerful approach that combines information retrieval with text generation to create more accurate and contextually relevant AI responses. Here are the key components and benefits:

1. Document Processing:
- RAG systems process and index documents to create searchable knowledge bases
- Documents are typically split into chunks and converted into vector embeddings
- Various document formats can be supported, including PDFs and text files

2. Information Retrieval:
- When a query is received, the system searches for relevant context
- Similarity matching using embeddings helps find the most relevant information
- Retrieved context is used to augment the AI's knowledge

3. Benefits of RAG:
- Improved accuracy by grounding responses in specific documents
- Reduced hallucination by providing factual context
- Real-time access to custom knowledge bases
- Support for domain-specific applications

4. Real-time Voice Integration:
- RAG can enhance voice-based AI interactions
- Context helps maintain conversation coherence
- Improves response relevance in voice applications

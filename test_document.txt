Machine Learning is a subset of artificial intelligence that focuses on training computer systems to learn from data and improve their performance without being explicitly programmed. It uses statistical techniques to enable computers to "learn" from examples and experiences.

Key concepts in machine learning include:
1. Supervised Learning: Training with labeled data where the model learns to map inputs to known outputs
2. Unsupervised Learning: Finding patterns and structures in unlabeled data without predefined outputs
3. Neural Networks: Computing systems inspired by biological neural networks that can learn complex patterns
4. Deep Learning: Advanced neural networks with multiple layers capable of learning hierarchical representations

Machine learning applications include:
- Image and Speech Recognition: Converting visual and audio inputs into digital understanding
- Natural Language Processing: Enabling computers to understand and generate human language
- Recommendation Systems: Predicting user preferences based on past behavior
- Autonomous Vehicles: Processing sensor data to make real-time driving decisions

The learning process typically involves:
1. Data Collection: Gathering relevant training data
2. Feature Engineering: Selecting and transforming input variables
3. Model Training: Adjusting model parameters using optimization algorithms
4. Validation: Testing the model's performance on unseen data
5. Deployment: Implementing the trained model in real-world applications
